        <p>When we first came here,
            We were cold and we were clear,
            With no colours on our skin,
            We were light and paper-thin.
            And when we first came here,
            We were cold and we were clear,
            With no colours on our skin,
            Till you let the spectrum in.</p>
	 <p>Say my name,
	And every colour illuminates,
	We are shining,
	And we’ll never be afraid again.

	Say my name!
	As every colour illuminates!
	We are shining!
	And we’ll never be afraid again!
	Say my name!
	As every colour illuminates!
	We are shining!
	And we’ll never be afraid again!
